The left vertical axis is the frequency of occurrence, but it can alternatively represent cost or another important unit of measure. The right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of occurrences, total cost, or total of the particular unit of measure. In market share study, Pareto charts are useful to reveal if the business is dominated by a handful of key products or customers.\nA Population Pyramid or “Age-Sex Pyramid” is a graphical illustration of the distribution of a population (typically that of a country or region of the world) by age groups and sex; it typically takes the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing. Males are usually shown on the left and females on the right, and they may be measured in absolute numbers or as a percentage of the total population.\nBefore processing to the next step, please use the code chunk below to install and launch the required packages in RStudio.\n\n\npackages = c('tidyverse', 'readxl', 'knitr')\n\nfor(p in packages){\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\n    install.packages(p)\n  }\n  library(p, character.only = T)\n}\n\n\n\n2.0 Pareto Chart\nImporting Data\nIn this exercise, superstore-2021 data set, an MS Excel workbook will be used. It consists of three worksheets, namely: Orders, People and Returns. First, import the data into R by using read_xls() of readr package.\n\n\norders <- read_xls(\"Data/Superstore-2021.xls\",\n                  sheet = \"Orders\")\nreturns <- read_xls(\"Data/Superstore-2021.xls\",\n                  sheet = \"Returns\")\n\n\n\nData Preparation\nJoining two dataframes\nIn order to produce a Pareto Chart which contains information on frequency of returns, we need to employee left_join() of dplyr to join the ‘Orders’ and ‘Returns’ worksheets by using Order ID as a unique identifier.\n\n\njoined_tab <- left_join(returns, orders,\n                        by = c('Order ID' = 'Order ID'))\n\n\n\nCount frequency of returns by sub-category using gtoup-by method\nTo achieve this, we need to use group-by() of dplyr package to group the data set by sub-category and summarise() to count the frequency of returns (i.e. n()) for each sub-category, a new dataframe named ‘freq_returned’ would be created to store the name of sub-categories and their respective number of returns. Please always remember to ungroup() after using groupby() as orelse you cannot performance any operations on the grouping variables, meaning they can’t be mutated or summarized.\n\n\nfreq_returned <- joined_tab %>%\n  group_by(`Sub-Category`) %>%\n  summarise('Returns' = n()) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n\n\nSorting data and Computing cumulative frequency\nBy default, the resultant ‘freq-returned’ data frame is sorted by values of first column, in this case, the alphabetical order of ‘sub-category’ field. To plot a Pareto chart, we need to rearrange the order by sorting the data frame in a descending order of count of returns. To achieve this, we need to use the arrange() of dplyr package.\n\n\nfreq_sorted <- freq_returned %>%\n  arrange(desc(Returns))\n\n\n\nTo compute the cumulative frequency of returns, we need to use mutate() of dplyr package and cumsum() of Base R. mutate() adds a new variable ‘cumfreq’ while preserving existing ones and cumsum() returns a cumulative sums vector to the ‘cumfreq’ field.\n\n\nfreq_cum <- freq_sorted %>%\n  mutate(cumfreq = cumsum(Returns))\n\n\n\nPlotting of Graph using ggplot2\nTo plot a Pareto chart:\n1. Use ggplot function to specify the data and the aesthetics of the column to be used.\n2. Use geom_bar() to create a bar chart using ‘Returns’ field as y-axis to indicate the absolute value of count of returns. The purpose of the stat=‘identity’ is to force ggplot to identify the count field stipulated on the y axis.\n3. Use geom_point() to plot a point geometry () with the points indicating the cumulative frequency calculated (the point type (pch) equal to a circle) and add to the bar chart plotted.\n4. Use the geom_line() function to connect the points and to specify what data type to group to (by default, group = 1)\n5. Use a few functions to edit the scale and finish the touch-up:\nscale_x_discrete(): use ‘limits’ argument to pass a character vector to defines values of the scale and their orderscale_y_continuous(): use ‘breaks’ and ‘limits’ arguments to pass vectors specifying the position and limits of scaleannotate(): add text labels for the axislabs(): add in title and name the axistheme(): change the background color to white for clear visualization\n\n\n# Defining variables to be used later for adjustment of scale\nnr <- nrow(freq_cum)\nN <- sum(freq_cum$Returns)\nDf_ticks <- data.frame(xtick0 = rep(nr +.55, 11), xtick1 = rep(nr +.59, 11), ytick = seq(0, N, N/10))\ny2 <- c(\"  0%\", \" 10%\", \" 20%\", \" 30%\", \" 40%\", \" 50%\", \" 60%\", \" 70%\", \" 80%\", \" 90%\", \"100%\")\n\n\n# Creating Pareto Chart with ggplot2\nggplot(freq_cum, aes(x=freq_cum$`Sub-Category`, y=freq_cum$Returns))+\n  geom_bar(fill = 'light blue', stat='identity') +\n  geom_point(aes(y=freq_cum$cumfreq), pch = 19, color = 'black', size = 0.8) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=freq_cum$cumfreq, group = 1), color = 'black', size = 0.5) + \n  scale_x_discrete(limits=freq_cum$`Sub-Category`) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, N, N/10), limits=c(-.02 * N, N * 1.02)) +\n  guides(fill = FALSE, color = FALSE) + \n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = nr + .55, xmax = nr + 1, \n             ymin = -.02 * N, ymax = N * 1.02, fill = \"white\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = nr + .8, y = seq(0, N, N/10), label = y2, size = 3.5) +\n  labs(title = 'Pareto Chart of Returns by sub-category', x = 'Sub-Category', y = 'absolute frequency') +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n3.0 Age-Sex Pyramid\nImporting Data\nThe dataset used in this exercise is Singapore Residents by Planning Area/ Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2021.csv, published by the Singapore Department of Statistics and was downloaded from the website.\nUsing read_csv() of readr package, we would be able to read delimited files into a tibble.\n\n\npopulation <- read_csv(\"Data/respopagesextod2021.csv\")\n\n\n\nData Preparation\nSelecting relevant columns\nAfter examining the imported data, we found out that to plot a age-sex pyramind, we only need values from 3 columns: age group, sex, and count of population within the age group and sex. So we use select() to create a new dataframe using only these relevant columns.\n\n\npopulation_selected <- population %>%\n  select(AG, Sex, Pop) \n\n\n\n\nComputing the frequency count by age and gender\nNext, we use groupby() to group the data set by age group and sex (i.e. males aged from 0 to 4) and then use summarise() to sum up the population count across different planning areas and residential properties. One more thing to note is that we need to use unique() to preserve original order of appearance of age group and specify this order to the grouped dataset by using factor().\n\n\n# Fixing order of age group\nAG_orders <- unique(population_selected$AG)\npopulation_selected$AG <- factor(population_selected$AG, levels = AG_orders, ordered = TRUE)\n\n# Computing the frequency count using group-by method\npopulation_selected <-\n  population_selected %>% \n  group_by(AG, Sex) %>% \n  summarise(Freq = sum(Pop)) \n\n\n\n\nIf we do not fix the order, the grouped data set may be sorted wrongly based on numerical order of the first digit of the age group, in this case, age group 5-9 would come after 45-49 as initial digit ‘5’ comes after ‘4’.\n\nModifying signs of population count\nIn order to plot a back-to-back bar chart as indicated in the population pyramid, the last step of data preparation is that we need to use mutate() function and ‘if_else’ to modify values in the ‘Freq’ column by changing the signals of males (+) and females (-). This will lead to males at the right side and females at the left side of the plot.\n\n\npopulation_count <- population_selected %>%\n  mutate(Freq = if_else(Sex == 'Males', -Freq, Freq))\n\n\n\n\nPlotting of Graph using ggplot2\nIn this case, we use geom_bar() again to create a bar with ‘Freq’ column as the initial y-axis. The explanation for the rest of the functions are listed below for your reference:coord_flip(): to flip the cartesian coordinates so that horizontal becomes vertical, and vertical becomes horizontal.scale_fill_manual(): to change legend labels and colors.scale_x_discrete: to customize the x-axis (now at the left side of the graph).scale_y_continuous(): to customize the y-axis (which is now at the bottom of the graph) breaks and labels.labs()：to set x and y-axis labels, add in titles and subtitles.theme_cowplot(): to set a cowplot theme from cowplot package.\n\n\nthe_order <- population_count$AG\n\n# Plotting the age-sex pyramid using ggplot2\nggplot(population_count, aes(x = AG, y = Freq, group = Sex, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.75) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = the_order) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-150000,150000,50000),\n                     labels = paste0(as.character(c(seq(150, 0, -50), seq(50, 150, 50))), \"K\"))+\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Population\", title = 'Age-Sex Pyramid of Singapore for 2021 Jun',\n       caption='Source: Singapore Department of Statistics') +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill =  \"grey90\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"darkred\", \"steelblue\"),\n                    name='',\n                    breaks=c(\"Males\", \"Females\"),\n                    labels=c(\"Males\", \"Females\"))+ \n  cowplot::theme_cowplot()+\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(vjust=.5),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color='lightgray',linetype='dashed'),\n        legend.position = 'top',\n        legend.justification = 'center')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
